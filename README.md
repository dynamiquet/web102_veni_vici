 Web Development Project 4 - Veni Vici!

Submitted by: **Dynamique Twizere**

This web app: **Allows users to discover random artworks from the Art Institute of Chicago's API. Users can ban specific attributes (e.g., artist, artwork type) to filter future results.**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed: 

- [x] **Application features a button that creates a new API fetch request on click and displays at least three attributes and an image obtained from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/data from API call response is viewable at a time and at least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **API call response results should appear random to the user**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes are clickable and can be added to the ban list.
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously displayed results from this session.
  - A dedicated section of the application displays all the previous images/attributes seen before.
  - Each time the API call button is clicked, the history updates with the newest API result.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] The ban list is displayed on the right side of the app for better usability.
- [x] The app uses a modern design inspired by a gradient-based theme with shadow effects and responsive layouts.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
- Truly understanding the idea of using useEffect() and working with "side effects" was challenging
- Styling the app to make it visually appealing was pretty easy as I was inspired by a design I had used for one of my apps ear.
